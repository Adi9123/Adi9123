# 💫 About Me:
I am a UAV Systems Engineer and FPV drone pilot focused on building, tuning, and validating real-world drone platforms. My work spans FPV racing drones and autonomous quadcopters, with hands-on experience in flight controller integration, PID tuning, telemetry systems, and embedded electronics.<br><br>I actively work with Pixhawk, SpeedyBee, and CrossFlight flight controllers using PX4 and ArduPilot ecosystems. My experience includes MAVLink-based telemetry, ground control systems, RF link optimization, and iterative flight testing under real operating conditions.<br><br>I follow an engineering-driven workflow—test, fail, diagnose, fix, and validate—using flight data and logs to improve stability, performance, and reliability. I have led UAV development and piloted FPV drones in competitive environments, contributing to a World Rank 3 finish at an international drone racing event.
